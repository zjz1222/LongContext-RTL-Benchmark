Module name:  
    aes_sbox  

Function description:  
    This module implements the AES S-box, a 256-byte substitution box used in AES encryption. It acts as a lookup table that takes an 8-bit input byte and outputs the corresponding 8-bit substituted value according to the AES standard. This specific implementation processes four bytes in parallel, effectively handling a full 32-bit word by performing substitution on each byte simultaneously.

Input ports:  
    sboxw [31:0]: A 32-bit input word, consisting of four bytes to be substituted via the AES S-box.

Output ports:  
    new_sboxw [31:0]: A 32-bit output word containing the substituted bytes corresponding to each input byte after applying the AES S-box.

Implementation:  
    The core of the design is a 256-element array of 8-bit values named "sbox," where each element stores the substitution value for the byte index according to the AES S-box lookup table. Each entry corresponds to one byte value (0x00 through 0xFF) mapped to its respective substitution byte.

    The module performs parallel lookup operations on the four individual bytes of the 32-bit input word `sboxw`. Each byte of `sboxw` (bits [31:24], [23:16], [15:8], and [7:0]) is used as an index to access the corresponding element in the sbox array. The results from the four lookups are then concatenated to form the 32-bit output word `new_sboxw`.

    The sbox array is statically assigned with fixed values matching the standard AES substitution box. This approach essentially implements the AES S-box as a combinational ROM that supports four parallel lookups to improve processing throughput for 32-bit data paths.

    No sequential logic or clock signals are used; the module purely uses combinational logic through wire assignments to implement the S-box functionality.
