Module name:  
    weight_buffer  

Function description:  
    This module implements a weight buffer memory with a 16-entry storage, where each entry is 128 bits wide. It provides synchronous read and write access to the memory, controlled by clock, chip enable, write enable, and a return enable signal. The buffer is intended to store weight data for processing elements, likely used in neural network or similar applications.

Input ports:  
    CLK: Clock signal for synchronization of read and write operations.  
    CEN: Chip Enable signal, active low, to enable read access to the memory.  
    WEN: Write Enable signal, active low, to enable write access to the memory.  
    A [12:0]: 13-bit address input to select the memory location for read or write operations (although only 16 locations are implemented, the upper bits are not used).  
    D [127:0]: 128-bit data input used for writing data into the memory.  
    RETN: Return Enable signal, active high, used to enable any memory operation (read or write).

Output ports:  
    Q [127:0]: 128-bit data output that provides the data read from the memory at the addressed location.

Implementation:  
    The module defines an internal memory array 'mem' consisting of 16 elements, each 128 bits wide. On the rising edge of the clock (CLK), the module checks the control signals:  
    - If WEN is low (write enabled) and RETN is high, a write operation occurs: the input data D is stored in the memory at address A, and the output Q is cleared to zero.  
    - If WEN is high and CEN is low (chip enabled for reading) and RETN is high, a read operation occurs: the content of memory at address A is assigned to the output Q.  
    - Otherwise, the output Q is set to zero.  
    Note that the address input A is 13 bits wide, but the memory depth is only 16 entries, so only the lower 4 bits are effectively used to address the memory.  
    The RETN signal acts as an overall enable to allow read or write operations to proceed; when RETN is low, the output remains zero regardless of other signals.  
    This design ensures synchronous memory access with clear separation between read and write operations controlled via WEN and CEN, and also clears the output when no valid operation is performed.
