Module name:  
    Accelerator  

Function description:  
    The Accelerator module is designed as a hardware accelerator for neural network or convolutional operations. It integrates input, weight, shared, and output memory buffers with a processing element (PE) array. The module coordinates data movement between these buffers and controls the PE array to perform computations on the input activations and weights. It operates synchronously at 200 MHz, using control signals to enable functionality and reset the design. The Accelerator interfaces with a shared SRAM for input, weight, and output data storage, orchestrated by an internal controller that manages addressing, enable, and read/write signals for these memories and the PE array.  

Input ports:  
    CLK: System clock input signal running at 200 MHz, used for synchronous operations.  
    RESET: Active-low reset signal, used to initialize or reset the accelerator.  
    EN: Enable signal, active-high to activate the accelerator¡¯s operation.  
    IADDR [12:0]: 13-bit input address for accessing input data in shared SRAM.  
    WADDR [12:0]: 13-bit weight address for accessing weight data in shared SRAM.  
    OADDR [12:0]: 13-bit output address for accessing output data in shared SRAM.  
    input_data [127:0]: 128-bit wide data input for writing into the shared buffer.  

Output ports:  
    STATE [5:0]: 6-bit wide output representing the current state of the controller or accelerator, primarily for testbench monitoring and debugging.  

Implementation:  
    The Accelerator module instantiates several submodules and interconnects them:  
    - **Controller:** Manages the accelerator's overall operation. It receives CLK, RESET, EN, and addresses (IADDR, WADDR, OADDR) as inputs and outputs control signals such as enables, chip enables, read enables, write enables, selector signals, and addresses for shared, input, weight, and output buffers/memories. It also provides the STATE output reflecting the running status of the accelerator.  
      
    - **Shared Buffer:** A 128-bit wide shared SRAM buffer interfaced via shared control signals from the controller (share_cen, share_wen, share_ren, share_addr). It takes input_data as its data input and outputs a 128-bit data bus (share_out) to other buffers.  
      
    - **Input Buffer:** A 128-bit memory module for input data. It is controlled by input-specific control signals (input_cen, input_wen, input_ren, input_addr) and receives data from the shared buffer (share_out). Its output (input_out) provides input activations to the PE array. It also accepts the RESET signal for initialization.  
      
    - **Weight Buffer:** Similar to the input buffer, the weight buffer stores weight data. It is controlled separately through weight-specific control signals (weight_cen, weight_wen, weight_ren, weight_addr) and receives data from the shared buffer (share_out). Its output (weight_out) provides weights to the PE array.  
      
    - **PE Array:** This module represents an array of processing elements, configured by parameters `num1=16` and `num2=16`, resulting in a large matrix of PEs for parallel computation. It takes input activations (input_out), weights (weight_out), control signals (CLK, RESET, EN, SELECTOR, W_EN), and outputs the final computed sums (out_sum). The PE array also provides a weighted output (out_weight_below), presumably fed back internally or used downstream (not connected outside this module).  
      
    - **Output Buffer:** Stores the final computation results from the PE array¡¯s out_sum data bus. Controlled by output-specific signals (output_cen, output_wen, output_ren, output_addr), it stores 16-bit segments from each PE and presents the stored result on output_out.  

    The data flows from the external input_data into the shared buffer, then selectively moved to the input and weight buffers based on the addresses and control signals from the controller. The PE array consumes inputs and weights to perform parallel computations and produces a combined output stored in the output buffer. The controller synchronizes these operations based on the enable and reset signals, generating the STATE output for runtime monitoring.  

    Note: Some commented code and parameters are placeholders indicating that in a real implementation, additional parameters like channel numbers, sizes, padding, strides, and shift values should be provided, possibly through instructions rather than testbench inputs. The RESET is active low, and all memory enables (CEN, WEN, REN) follow standard active low or active high conventions (as implied by naming, but not explicitly commented). The module is highly modular and tailored for high-throughput neural network acceleration.

    Functionality:  
        This module is a control unit designed for managing data flow and processing stages of a hardware accelerator, typically used in neural network or convolutional processing. It controls the states of loading weights and activations from shared buffers into dedicated weight and activation buffers, manages the processing element (PE) enable signals, and handles output data writing. The controller orchestrates data movement between shared memory buffers and specialized internal buffers through several operational states, ensuring proper sequencing of data input, computation, and output phases.
