Module name:  
    adder_32  

Function description:  
    This module implements a custom 32-bit adder that adds a 32-bit input `A` and a 30-bit input `B` (with zero or implicit extension for the upper bits). The result is a 32-bit sum `C`. The adder uses a combination of half adders, full adders (implemented as 3-to-2 compressors), and XOR gates to efficiently generate the sum and carry bits while handling the mismatch in input widths. It is specifically optimized with detailed gate-level resource considerations indicated in the header comments.  

Input ports:  
    A [31:0]: A 32-bit input operand.  
    B [29:0]: A 30-bit input operand, aligned so that lower bits correspond starting from B[0].  

Output ports:  
    C [31:0]: A 32-bit output sum, representing the addition of inputs A and B with proper carry propagation and bit alignment.  

Implementation:  
    - The two least significant bits of the sum `C[1:0]` are assigned directly from `A[1:0]` since `B` does not cover these bits.  
    - Bit 2 of the sum `C[2]` is generated by a half adder that adds `A[2]` and `B[0]` because the carry-in to this bit position is zero initially.  
    - Bit 3 of the sum `C[3]` is generated using a full adder realized as a 3-to-2 compressor that sums `A[3]`, `B[1]`, and the carry from the previous half adder.  
    - Bit 4 uses a half adder since `B[2]` is always zero for this bit position, adding `A[4]` and the carry from bit 3.  
    - Bits 5 to 7 are produced using full adders (3-to-2 compressors) in a generate loop, adding `A[i]`, `B[i-2]`, and the carry from the previous stage.  
    - Bit 8 is computed by a half adder, adding `A[8]` and the carry from bit 7 because `B[6]` is zero at this position.  
    - Bits 9 to 30 are calculated similarly with full adders in a generate loop, adding the corresponding bits of `A` and `B` offset by two, along with carry input.  
    - The most significant bit (`C[31]`) is computed using a two-level XOR approach: first XOR of `A[31]` and `B[29]`, followed by XOR with the carry from bit 30, effectively finalizing the addition.  
    - Internal carry signals are wired through a 29-bit wide wire array, `cout_adder_32bit`, to propagate carry bits between adders appropriately.  
    - The design leverages the module `compressor_3_2` as a full adder, and `half_adder` modules for summing two bits with carry generation.  
    - The architecture is documented with gate-level resource usage for insight into hardware complexity and transistor counts.  
    - The methodical use of half adders at positions where one operand bit is guaranteed zero reduces unnecessary logic, improving efficiency.  
    - This adder structure handles unaligned bit widths by proper indexing and selective use of adders, tailoring the addition to inputs of different sizes without zero-padding or extension logic explicitly shown.

Submodules:
    - half_adder  
    Input ports:  
        a: a 1-bit input operand  
        b: a 1-bit input operand  
    Output ports:  
        cout: a 1-bit output representing the carry-out from the addition of inputs a and b  
        sum: a 1-bit output representing the sum of inputs a and b 
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a half adder circuit using basic logic gates. It performs the addition of two single-bit binary inputs, producing a sum and a carry-out (cout) bit. The design optimizes transistor usage by reusing intermediate signals within the XOR gate structure, thereby reducing the overall number of MOS transistors needed.
    
    - compressor_3_2
    Input ports:  
        i0: First single-bit input operand.  
        i1: Second single-bit input operand.  
        ci: Carry-in single-bit input operand.
    Output ports:  
        co: Carry-out single-bit output resulting from the addition.  
        d: Sum (or difference) single-bit output resulting from the addition.
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a 3:2 compressor, which essentially functions as a full adder. It computes the sum and carry outputs from three single-bit inputs. The internal design focuses on an efficient XOR gate structure by reusing intermediate results generated inside the module, thus reducing the number of MOS transistors needed for the full adder implementation.
    
    You can call these submodules without instantiating them to implement the functionality of the module.
