Module name:  
    in_1_compressor_4_2  

Function description:  
    This module implements a modified 4:2 compressor where one of the inputs in the first stage of the internal 3:2 compressor (specifically the carry-in, ci, of the second stage) is fixed to 1 as per the design description. The first stage¡¯s 3:2 compressor is replaced by an equivalent "XNOR gate" constructed using basic logic gates to reduce transistor count and resource usage. The overall function is to compress four input bits plus a carry-in into two outputs representing partial sum and carry bits.

Input ports:  
    i0: First input bit of the compressor (logic 1-bit)  
    i1: Second input bit of the compressor (logic 1-bit)  
    i3: Third input bit of the compressor (logic 1-bit)  
    ci: Carry-in input to the second stage 3:2 compressor (logic 1-bit)  

Output ports:  
    co: Carry-out output from the first stage, representing the OR of i0 and i1  
    c: Carry output from the second stage compressor  
    d: Sum output from the second stage compressor  

Implementation:  
    The first stage 3:2 compressor is implemented as an equivalent XNOR gate formed by combining OR and NAND gates to minimize transistor count.  
    - First, an OR operation on inputs i0 and i1 is performed producing the intermediate wire i0_OR_i1.  
    - Then a NAND operation on i0 and i1 generates i0_NAND_i1.  
    - These two wires are then NANDed together to produce an XNOR function (i0_xnor_i1), which acts as the sum output of the first stage 3:2 compressor.  
    The output co is directly assigned from the OR of i0 and i1 (i0_OR_i1), reusing the intermediate calculation without additional hardware cost.  
    The second stage 3:2 compressor is instantiated from a module named `compressor_3_2`, taking the XNOR output from the first stage (i0_xnor_i1), input i3, and the carry-in ci as inputs. It produces outputs c (carry) and d (sum).  
    This structure optimizes transistor and gate usage by reusing intermediate signals and replacing typical 3:2 compressor stages with equivalent simpler gate-level implementations.  
    Resource usage counting comments specify that the overall design includes one 3:2 compressor module, one OR gate, and two NAND gates as main components, totaling 46 transistors.

Submodules:
    - compressor_3_2
    Input ports:  
        i0: First single-bit input operand.  
        i1: Second single-bit input operand.  
        ci: Carry-in single-bit input operand.
    Output ports:  
        co: Carry-out single-bit output resulting from the addition.  
        d: Sum (or difference) single-bit output resulting from the addition.
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a 3:2 compressor, which essentially functions as a full adder. It computes the sum and carry outputs from three single-bit inputs. The internal design focuses on an efficient XOR gate structure by reusing intermediate results generated inside the module, thus reducing the number of MOS transistors needed for the full adder implementation.

    You can call these submodules without instantiating them to implement the functionality of the module.
