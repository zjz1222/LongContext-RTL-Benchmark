Module name:  
    in_0_compressor_4_2  

Function description:  
    This module implements a modified 4:2 compressor where one of the input bits (i0) is fixed to zero. Essentially, it performs compression for four input bits with a carry-in (ci), producing two carry outputs and one sum output. The design uses a half adder for the first stage (since i0 is zero) followed by a standard 3:2 compressor for the second stage.

Input ports:  
    i1: First input bit (single bit)  
    i2: Second input bit (single bit)  
    i3: Third input bit (single bit)  
    ci: Carry input bit (single bit)  

Output ports:  
    co: Carry output from the first half adder stage (single bit)  
    c: Carry output from the 3:2 compressor stage (single bit)  
    d: Sum output from the 3:2 compressor stage (single bit)  

Implementation:  
    The module internally connects the first two input bits (i1 and i2) to a half adder. Since the original 4:2 compressor¡¯s first input i0 is fixed to zero here, the first stage reduces to a half adder, producing a carry output (co) and a sum (wire_d).  
    The sum from this half adder (wire_d), together with the third input bit (i3) and the carry input (ci), are then fed into a standard 3:2 compressor module. This second stage outputs a carry (c) and a sum (d).  
    This hierarchical design optimizes the logic when one of the inputs is statically zero, reducing the first compression stage to a half adder and consequently simplifying the overall compression logic.  
    The module is resource-efficient with a gate-level count summarized in the comments, indicating the use of various basic gates and totaling 46 transistors across the submodules instantiated.

Submodules:
    - compressor_3_2
    Input ports:  
        i0: First single-bit input operand.  
        i1: Second single-bit input operand.  
        ci: Carry-in single-bit input operand.
    Output ports:  
        co: Carry-out single-bit output resulting from the addition.  
        d: Sum (or difference) single-bit output resulting from the addition.
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a 3:2 compressor, which essentially functions as a full adder. It computes the sum and carry outputs from three single-bit inputs. The internal design focuses on an efficient XOR gate structure by reusing intermediate results generated inside the module, thus reducing the number of MOS transistors needed for the full adder implementation.

    You can call these submodules without instantiating them to implement the functionality of the module.
