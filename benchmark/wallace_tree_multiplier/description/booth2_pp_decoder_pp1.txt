Module name:  
    booth2_pp_decoder_pp1

Function description:  
    This module is a dedicated decoder for generating the first partial product (pp1) in a Booth multiplication algorithm implementation. It processes a 2-bit simplified Booth code (since the least significant bit of the original 3-bit Booth code is always zero for the first partial product) along with the multiplicand A and its inverted form (-A) to produce an 18-bit partial product output. The module handles generating the partial product corresponding to the inputs according to the Booth encoding rules and optimizes the logic circuit usage.

Input ports:  
    code_2bit [1:0]: A 2-bit Booth code input, representing {b1, b0} bits of the Booth encoding used to determine the multiplication factor for the current partial product. The lowest bit b-1 is always zero and thus omitted.  
    A [15:0]: The 16-bit multiplicand input.  
    inversed_A [16:0]: The 17-bit inverted multiplicand (-A), provided to simplify the circuit for producing negative multiples.

Output ports:  
    pp_out [17:0]: An 18-bit output which is the generated partial product based on the Booth code and inputs. The width accommodates results such as -2 * 16'h8000 which requires 18 bits.

Implementation:  
    The module uses a simplified Booth decoding scheme specialized for the first partial product where the least significant Booth bit is fixed to zero. It derives three key flags from the 2-bit code:  
      - flag_2x indicates whether the partial product is multiplied by 2 (set when code_2bit[0] is 0).  
      - flag_s1 indicates sign inversion (set by code_2bit[1]).  
      - flag_s2 is generated by NOR gate of code_2bit[1] and inverted code_2bit[0], indicates another control condition for the data source.

    The partial product source data (pp_source) is selected between the multiplicand A and its inverted form (-A) based on the flags, implemented as bitwise logic using NOR gates and bitwise AND masks. Notably, the output pp_source is the bitwise inversion of the selected data.

    The lowest bit of the partial product (pp_out[0]) is generated using a NOR gate combining the flag_2x and the least significant bit of pp_source, reflecting that the lowest bit is only set when the partial product is A or -A (not 2A/-2A).

    The next 16 bits (pp_out[16:1]) are computed using the flags to select whether to shift the pp_source by one bit to the right (effectively multiplying by 2), combined with bitwise negation and OR/NOR logic implemented by 16 AOI4 gates. This logic forms the core Booth partial product generation, efficiently combining sign and doubling indicators.

    The highest bit (pp_out[17]) acts as the inverted sign bit ("negative" logic) of the partial product. It is assigned directly from pp_source[16] without extra gates as an optimization, since for A or -A partial products, pp_source[17] equals pp_source[16]. The sign is inverted here deliberately to reduce the need for extra NOT gates downstream.

    Overall, the module uses a total of 36 gates (1 NOT, 2 NOR, and 33 AOI4 gates) and 274 transistors, as documented in the header comments, to implement a compact and efficient partial product decoder tailored for the Booth multiplication scheme¡¯s first partial product.
