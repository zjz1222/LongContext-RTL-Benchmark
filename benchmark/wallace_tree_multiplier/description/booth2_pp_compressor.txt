Module name:  
    booth2_pp_compressor  

Function description:  
    This module performs partial product compression for a 16-bit multiplier using the Booth-2 algorithm. It takes eight 18-bit partial products (PP1 to PP8), generated by Booth-2 encoding of the multiplier, and compresses them into two partial products outputs (PPout1 and PPout2) using a multi-level compressor tree with 3:2 and 4:2 compressors. The module employs a sign-bit encoding scheme to correctly handle signed multiplication partial products during compression.

Input ports:  
    PP1 [17:0]: The first partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier, corresponding to the lowest encoded multiplier bit.  
    PP2 [17:0]: The second partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP3 [17:0]: The third partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP4 [17:0]: The fourth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP5 [17:0]: The fifth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP6 [17:0]: The sixth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP7 [17:0]: The seventh partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
    PP8 [17:0]: The eighth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier, corresponding to the highest encoded multiplier bit.  

Output ports:  
    PPout1 [31:0]: The first compressed partial product output after multi-level compression.  
    PPout2 [29:0]: The second compressed partial product output after multi-level compression; its lower bits have not yet been zero-padded.  

Implementation:  
    - The module first encodes each partial product's sign bits with a sign-bit encoding scheme that facilitates correct signed multiplication compression. PP1's sign bit is inverted because the original "sign bit" in PP1 is in inverted logic, and twice this bit is appended in its encoded vector (making PP1_code 20 bits wide). All other partial products' codes (PP2_code to PP8_code) prepend a logic '1' as part of the encoding, resulting in 19-bit codes.

    - The compression is done in two major stages:

      1. **First level compression:**  
         - Compresses the encoded partial products PP1_code through PP4_code into two new partial products PPC1_1 and PPC1_2 using multiple 3:2 and 4:2 compressors.  
         - Similarly, PP5_code through PP8_code are compressed into PPC1_3 and PPC1_4.  
         - Several generate loops instantiate arrays of 3:2 and 4:2 compressors to handle different bit indices efficiently.  
         - Special variants of 4:2 compressors are used when some inputs are constants (0 or 1), reducing hardware complexity and avoiding extensive carry chaining.  
         - The highest and lowest bits are assigned directly to outputs when they don't require compression.  
         - Partial products' sign-related bits are carefully handled using NOT gates and direct assignments.

      2. **Second level compression:**  
         - Takes the four partial products from the first stage (PPC1_1, PPC1_2, PPC1_3, PPC1_4) and compresses them further into two partial products PPC2_1 and PPC2_2.  
         - Uses similar arrays of 3:2 and 4:2 compressors instantiated via generate statements over relevant bit indices.  
         - Again, compressor variants that handle inputs fixed to 0 or 1 are used to optimize the design.  
         - Higher bit positions that only have two inputs are compressed using half-adders.  
         - The highest bit of PPC2_1 is produced by XOR of the highest bits of PPC1_4 and PPC1_3 to complete the compression for the final partial product.  
         - Unused or unchanged bits from the previous stage are directly assigned in the outputs, preserving correct values.  
         - Some bits known to be zero are explicitly set, simplifying downstream processing.

    - The module outputs PPout1 and PPout2 are the final compressed partial products ready for further addition stages in the multiplier design.

    - The design employs multiple levels of parallel compressors to reduce the critical path delay and gate count while correctly handling sign bits for signed multiplication. It makes use of detailed wiring, generate loops, and specialized compressor modules for optimal performance and resource usage.

    - Comments and resource estimations in the source code indicate gate-level resource counts and transistor counts for various submodules, evidencing careful hardware cost considerations in the design.

In summary, the booth2_pp_compressor module efficiently compresses eight Booth-2 encoded partial products with sign bit encoding into two compressed partial products using multi-level 3:2 and 4:2 compressors, enabling an optimized signed 16-bit multiplication implementation.

Essentially, it performs compression for four input bits with a carry-in (ci), producing two carry outputs and one sum output. The design uses a half adder for the first stage (since i0 is zero) followed by a standard 3:2 compressor for the second stage.

        c: Carry output from the second stage compressor  
        d: Sum output from the second stage compressor  
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a modified 4:2 compressor where one of the inputs in the first stage of the internal 3:2 compressor (specifically the carry-in, ci, of the second stage) is fixed to 1 as per the design description. The first stage¡¯s 3:2 compressor is replaced by an equivalent "XNOR gate" constructed using basic logic gates to reduce transistor count and resource usage. The overall function is to compress four input bits plus a carry-in into two outputs representing partial sum and carry bits.
