Module name:  
    booth2_pp_decoder

Function description:  
    This module implements a Booth radix-4 partial product decoder. It takes a 3-bit Booth-encoded input `code` and a 16-bit multiplicand `A` along with its 17-bit bitwise inversion `inversed_A` (representing -A), and outputs an 18-bit partial product (`pp_out`). The output partial product is provided in an inverted logic form, with the highest bit being the inverted sign bit, to facilitate subsequent signed arithmetic operations in multiplication.

Input ports:  
    code [2:0]: The 3-bit Booth encoded multiplier bits representing the current partial product encoding for Radix-4 Booth multiplication.  
    A [15:0]: The original multiplicand input.  
    inversed_A [16:0]: The bitwise inverted version of multiplicand `A` extended to 17 bits, representing -A in two's complement format.

Output ports:  
    pp_out [17:0]: The 18-bit partial product output generated according to the Booth encoding. The output is in inverted logic form, especially the most significant bit which is inverted to simplify sign handling in multiplication.

Implementation:  
    The module generates partial products based on the input 3-bit Booth code, using logic to decode which multiple of the multiplicand to use: 0, ¡ÀA, or ¡À2A. It defines three key flags (`flag_2x`, `flag_s1`, `flag_s2`) to represent these conditions:

    - `flag_2x`: Indicates whether to multiply the multiplicand by 2 (for 2A or -2A).  
    - `flag_s1` and `flag_s2`: Determine the sign and multiplicand selection (A or -A).

    The flags are derived from the Booth code using combinations of NOT, AND, and NOR gates:
    - Inverted bit 2 (`~code[2]`), AND and NOR of bits 1 and 0 are combined to produce intermediate signals utilized in generating the flags.
    - The `flag_not_2x` is the inverse of `flag_2x`, used for selecting the required partial product components.

    Based on these flags, the module selects the source partial product bits from either `A` or `inversed_A` (representing -A) by bitwise operations:

    - `pp_source` is computed as the inverted OR of masked `A` and `inversed_A` based on `flag_s2` and `flag_s1`. Since the partial product is in inverted logic, the final selection involves bitwise NOT operations and masking.

    The partial product output bits are then derived as:
    - The least significant bit `pp_out[0]` is generated by a NOR of the `flag_2x` and the first bit of `pp_source`, to guarantee zero output when the partial product corresponds to 2A or -2A.
    - The bits `pp_out[16:1]` are generated using a combination of AND and OR operations implementing:
      `pp_out[i] = flag_2x & (~pp_source[i-1]) + flag_not_2x & (~pp_source[i])`
      This corresponds to either shifting the multiplicand by one bit (multiplying by 2) or taking it unshifted, based on the flag.
    - The most significant bit `pp_out[17]` is assigned directly as `pp_source[16]` (inverted sign bit), which is used during partial product compression in multiplication. This bit is not inverted further because of the specific logic representation used in the multiplier design.

    The module uses a total of 2 NOT gates, 1 AND gate, 5 NOR gates for decoding, and 33 AOI4 gates (AND-OR-Invert with 4 inputs) for implementing the partial product logic, balancing gate count and transistor count as noted in the comments.

    Overall, the design optimizes resource usage by reusing intermediate signals and carefully structuring logic to achieve the desired partial product generation for Booth radix-4 multiplier architectures.
