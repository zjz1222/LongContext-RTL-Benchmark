Module name:  
    mult_16_16_top  

Function description:  
    This module implements a 16-bit by 16-bit signed multiplier using Radix-4 Booth encoding for partial product generation and a Wallace tree compression algorithm to efficiently sum the partial products. It produces a 32-bit signed multiplication result.

Input ports:  
    A_NUM [15:0]: 16-bit signed multiplicand.  
    B_NUM [15:0]: 16-bit signed multiplier.  

Output ports:  
    C_NUM [31:0]: 32-bit signed product of the multiplication.  

Implementation:  
    The multiplier is structured into three main functional blocks:

    1. Partial Product Generation (booth2_pp_gen):  
        This block takes the 16-bit inputs A_NUM and B_NUM and generates eight 18-bit partial products using the Radix-4 Booth algorithm. These partial products (PP1 through PP8) represent the multiplicand multiplied by encoded pieces of the multiplier, without sign extension or zero padding of lower bits at this stage.

    2. Partial Product Compression (booth2_pp_compressor):  
        The eight 18-bit partial products are then input to this module, which implements a Wallace tree compression technique. It compresses the eight partial products into two outputs:
            - PPcompressed1: a 32-bit wide partial sum.  
            - PPcompressed2: a 30-bit wide partial sum, with the two least significant bits guaranteed to be zero (ignored here for simplification).

        This compression reduces the number of operands to be summed, improving speed and efficiency.

    3. Final Addition (adder_32):  
        The two compressed partial results are added together through a 32-bit adder to produce the final multiplication product C_NUM.

    The overall multiplier design is signed and uses efficient hardware algorithms to optimize performance and resource usage. Comments in the source also indicate gate-level counts and transistor estimates for various components, emphasizing the hardware resource considerations of the design.

Submodules:
    - booth2_pp_compressor  
    Input ports:  
        PP1 [17:0]: The first partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier, corresponding to the lowest encoded multiplier bit.  
        PP2 [17:0]: The second partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP3 [17:0]: The third partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP4 [17:0]: The fourth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP5 [17:0]: The fifth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP6 [17:0]: The sixth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP7 [17:0]: The seventh partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier.  
        PP8 [17:0]: The eighth partial product from the Booth-2 multiplier, corresponding to the highest encoded multiplier bit.  
    Output ports:  
        PPout1 [31:0]: The first compressed partial product output after multi-level compression.  
        PPout2 [29:0]: The second compressed partial product output after multi-level compression; its lower bits have not yet been zero-padded.  
    Functionality:  
        This module performs partial product compression for a 16-bit multiplier using the Booth-2 algorithm. It takes eight 18-bit partial products (PP1 to PP8), generated by Booth-2 encoding of the multiplier, and compresses them into two partial products outputs (PPout1 and PPout2) using a multi-level compressor tree with 3:2 and 4:2 compressors. The module employs a sign-bit encoding scheme to correctly handle signed multiplication partial products during compression.
    
    - booth2_pp_gen  
    Input ports:  
        A_NUM [15:0]: 16-bit multiplicand input.  
        B_NUM [15:0]: 16-bit multiplier input.  
    Output ports:  
        PP1, PP2, PP3, PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, PP8 [17:0]: Eight 18-bit partial product outputs generated from the Booth encoded slices of the multiplier. Each partial product is 18 bits wide to accommodate sign representation for negative multiples.
    Functionality:  
        This module generates eight partial product operands for a 16x16 multiplier using the Radix-4 Booth encoding algorithm. It takes the multiplicand and multiplier as inputs and outputs eight 18-bit partial products. These partial products correspond to weighted multiples of the multiplicand based on 3-bit overlapping slices of the multiplier and include handling of negative multiples using a specialized inverse converter circuit.

    - adder_32   
    Input ports:  
        A [31:0]: A 32-bit input operand.  
        B [29:0]: A 30-bit input operand, aligned so that lower bits correspond starting from B[0].  
    Output ports:  
        C [31:0]: A 32-bit output sum, representing the addition of inputs A and B with proper carry propagation and bit alignment.  
    Functionality:  
        This module implements a custom 32-bit adder that adds a 32-bit input `A` and a 30-bit input `B` (with zero or implicit extension for the upper bits). The result is a 32-bit sum `C`. The adder uses a combination of half adders, full adders (implemented as 3-to-2 compressors), and XOR gates to efficiently generate the sum and carry bits while handling the mismatch in input widths. It is specifically optimized with detailed gate-level resource considerations indicated in the header comments. 
    
     You can call these submodules without instantiating them to implement the functionality of the module.
