Module name:  
    inv_unit_nor_out  

Function description:  
    This module implements a specialized inverter unit used within the "negate and add one" module (inv_converter_16) to generate the inverted value of "-A[15]". Essentially, it realizes an XOR gate function by reusing internal NOR gates, providing a more resource-efficient alternative to a typical inverter unit. Unlike other inverter units that use an OR gate for output, this unit replaces that with an XOR configuration, reducing the gate and transistor count.

Input ports:  
    a: A 1-bit input signal.  
    b: A 1-bit input signal.  

Output ports:  
    xor_o: A 1-bit output representing the XOR operation of inputs a and b, implemented via a combination of NOR and AND gates.  
    nor_o: A 1-bit output providing the NOR operation result of inputs a and b.  

Implementation:  
    The module uses two intermediate signals:  
    - a_AND_b: the logical AND of inputs a and b, computed using an AND gate.  
    - a_NOR_b: the logical NOR of inputs a and b, computed using a NOR gate (inverted OR).  

    The module output signals are assigned as follows:  
    - xor_o is generated by applying an OR gate on the intermediate AND and NOR signals, followed by inversion (a NOR operation on a_AND_b and a_NOR_b), effectively resulting in an XOR function without explicitly instantiating an XOR gate.  
    - nor_o directly outputs the NOR of inputs a and b.  

    This approach leverages NOR gates to synthesize the XOR behavior, which decreases resource usage compared to a standard inverter unit that employs an OR gate for output. The gate utilization summary indicates one AND gate and two NOR gates involved, totaling three gates and fourteen transistors, thus optimizing the hardware cost.
